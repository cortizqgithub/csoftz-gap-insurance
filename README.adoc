V1.0.0-May.04/2018

Here we can find an excercise a CRUD interface for insurance policy.

Here we find some folders.
The main folder is named 'app-code' which contains all the source code for the solution.
Therein you can find two folders named: 'client' and 'microservices'.
The 'client' contains an ANGULAR (version 5.x using the Angular CLI to build it) 
project. NOTE: Not usable at this moment.

The 'microservices' folder holds a ASP.NET Core (Version 2.x) solution, it is
thought as it were to be a microservice.

The .NET solution holds two projects. One is a ASP.NET Core Web API which implements
the whole Rest API. NOTE: All data is held in memory, thus if server is restared, all
saved data is destroyed.

The other project is ASP.NET Core MVC Web App to consume that API.
